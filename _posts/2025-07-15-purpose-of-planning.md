## Agile Estimating and Planning; Chapter 1

We have to make some kind of plan if we are going to develop software as a business. We have 
to have some idea of who is going to do what for how much and when. And if there are a series 
of steps, or integrations or external needs, we need to know when and how to prepare them. These 
are pretty essential business needs and, if we're building something useful, we need to be able to 
support them with a plan. 

The immediate problem is the cone of uncertainty. The farther out you are from completion of a project, 
the less certain you can be about when it will be completed. Initial estimates may be anywhere from 60 
to 160 percent of the actual time to completion. Each iteration of the planning process brings us closer 
to the project completion, so we can narrow that range each time as we either discover or clear obstacles. 

Ok, so if we accept from the start that plans are unreliable, sometimes wildly so, what's the point? 

Cohn offers several reasons: 
#### Reducing Risk
When you plan a project, you have to start breaking down the steps, the pieces, the parts and the 
requirements to make it a reality. Sometimes that means you make an investment in time to learn 
about or explore the potential areas for risk (spiking it out). Sometimes reviewing the requirements 
and practicalities reveal the cost is too high to pursue, and other times by predicting the challenges 
you'll face ahead, you can ensure the preceding steps help to mitigate it. 

#### Reducing Uncertainty
This means not only reducing the uncertainty about the challenges left to overcome and how the new 
product or tools will work, but Cohn also makes an excellent point that iterative planning also 
reduces the uncertainty that the right product is being created. 
As early results are reviewed, the direction, features and needs of the project may evolve, and, 
he argues, _should_ evolve. Taking both the knowledge gained by the team and the feedback obtained 
from the client into account for the next iteration of planning should result in greater certainty 
about the success of the product. 

#### Supporting Better Decision-Making
Everything comes with tradeoffs and having a plan, even a not exactly accurate one, can help make
business decisions. If the initial estimate for a project is that it will take 7 months to develop 
a whatsit, but the whatsit competition entry deadline is in 3 weeks, this isn't a plan worth pursuing. 
Or, if you could make the whatsit in 3 weeks, but it would cost 8 times your budget, that's still not 
a plan worth pursuing. It's best to find out as early as possible if a particular direction is a waste of 
time or resources. 
This can also be on a smaller scale, like a particular feature instead of an entire project. Knowing 
the estimate on a more granular level paves the way for better business decisions. 

#### Establishing Trust
If a development team practices iterative planning and establishes trust with the client, then the 
development team is much more likely to be regarded as a trusted partner in the decision process. 
If the team sees that some requirement change might lead to a notable reduction in time or cost while 
having minimal impact on the product, the client benefits! But only if trust has been established by 
reliable delivery of prior estimates. 

If estimates can be given accurately enough that the code is written well, has few bugs, and the developers 
can work at a steady pace (not a sprint!) it builds a foundation for future reliable estimates because 
the developers won't be exhausted, working on unpredictable tasks like bug hunting, and have a clean 
code base to work with. Wins all around.

#### Conveying Information
Cohn proposes that a plan is not just a date, but a description of a possibility. It "does not guarantee 
an exact set of features on an exact date at a specified cost."
 It's a more general, flexible documentation of a range of time, as well as baseline expectations 
that should be based on some amount of research, stated assumptions, initial points of progress 
with an expectation of continued collaboration to modify and refine the plan over time. 



Cohn emphasizes that the plan itself matters very little, but that the planning process, as an iterative, 
collaborative process that invites change is what is valuable. Plans should be easily changed, but the 
activity of planning is what helps to ensure the best product is made.
