## When you only might want to do some threading, unless it's nil

Sometimes you have a piece of data that you want to transform (only always, right?)
But, sometimes that data might not actually be there. You only want to call the 
transformations if it exists (lets not go getting those null pointer exceptions going)!

You might have some function that goes like: 
````
(defn add-form-data-to-state [request state]
  (let [form-data (get-form-data request)
        response (when (seq form-data) (keyword (first (vals form-data))))]
    (if (seq form-data)
      (assoc state :response response)
      state)))
````
If you have form data, get the value, just the first one, then turn it into a keyword. 
Then you're clear to add it to the state. 

We could make this a little better by threading it: 

````
        response (when (seq form-data)
                    (-> form-data 
                     vals 
                     first 
                     keyword))]
````
But, it turns out we can simplify the conditional and combine it with the instructions 
to thread in a single function: some->

````
(defn add-form-data-to-state [request state]
  (let [form-data (get-form-data request)
        response (some-> form-data vals first keyword)]
    (if (seq form-data)
      (assoc state :response response)
      state)))
````

Now you have a much more readable (and shorter!) function.

This is remarkably similar functionality to another handy function, cond->
As you may suspect, cond-> is a threader, but instead of listing just the functions
you'd like to use in your transformation, you can also provide the conditions on which you do!

So, this method can get cleaner still with: 

````
(defn add-form-data-to-state [request state]
  (let [form-data (get-form-data request)
        response (some-> form-data vals first keyword)]
    (cond-> state 
        (seq form-data) (assoc :response response))))
````
It will only conditionally modify the state based on the result of (seq form-data). You 
could even have multiple conditions and transformations listed, and it will go through all of them, 
but only perform the ones who have conditions that are true.
