I've been thinking a lot lately about these corduroy pants.

I have an older sister, and we both have an older cousin. When we were young, my parents didn't see the sense in buying new clothes for kids who were just going to outgrow them in a year or two (if you're lucky to even keep them that long) and so, boxes of my cousin's clothes would arrive for my sister to wear, and when she grew out of them and I grew into them, they'd migrate from her closet to mine. 

Most of the time it was fine, but I'll be honest, the jumpsuits that were 'in' when my cousin was in elementary school were -not- cool by the time I was wearing them, 12 years later. You'll just have to take my word that I was not a fashionably dressed youngster, but I was also wearing sweatpants with dresses and didn't care. 

I didn't care, until the corduroy pants. Look, these pants were **cool**. They were wide-legged, drawstring pants that were finally a piece that wasn't going to _look_ like I was dressed over a decade ago. I was so looking forward to these pants. But, as per the system, they went to my sister first. She was taller, and they were long enough for her. But they were so comfortable (and she had maybe gotten through most of her growth), she never grew out of them. 

She moved to a school with a uniform. She wasn't even going to be able to wear them anymore! She held on to them. They were still hers. 

I got taller. They would be the right length for me now too! They were still hers. 

I had the perfect top to go with them, and I was _**finally**_ going to look cool at school!! They were still hers. 

Time was running out until I was going to be at a school with a uniform, it was about to be a moot point! They were still hers. 

6 years after the pants arrived at our house, they had been worn to death. The corduroy was worn away in patches, the hems were scuffed, there were a few scattered stains. My sister left for college, and I got the pants, just in time to switch to uniforms for school. 

I wore her uniform skirts every day for 4 more years.
