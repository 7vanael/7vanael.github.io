## Agile Estimating and Planning; Chapter 2

The majority of this chapter is an inditement of waterfall software development. It argues that most plans 
are made by activity (Add tables to database -> code middle tier -> test) and details the numerous reasons
that's a terrible idea. Most of his points are well addressed by agile development that focuses on early 
functional product delivery and subsequent delivery of features as prioritized by the client. 

He has a few points that are still worth making note of, even in an agile framework: 

#### Multitasking Causes Further Delays
Efficiency peaks at 2 tasks assigned simultaneously. Cohn posits that if you have two assigned tasks, 
you can switch to task B if you get blocked on task A. Over time you may figure out how to not be blocked 
by A (or fill your time productively until it's convenient for help to arrive) and then can continue to 
make progress there. Adding additional tasks only diminishes productivity, likely caused at least in 
part to frequent context switching. 

#### Uncertainty goes Ignored
When we pretend we can assign precise estimates to imprecise work, that's ignoring the uncertainty 
of the task. He proposes a date range instead of a single date, and that range may get more narrow 
the closer we get to it. And, if we plan iteratively, even if we were inaccurate the first time, 
we should get more accurate the next.


#### Estimates are not Commitments
Cohn's final warning is that Estimates are not the same as Commitments. There's a probability in every 
project and the development team may feel 100% certain they can deliver it as currently specified in 1 
year and 0% chance they can deliver it tomorrow, the real date is somewhere in between and the 
 likely with a confidence level somewhere below 100%. If you want 100% confidence, it would have to be 
far too long a time frame. So, to accept a reasonable time frame, we must accept that an estimate is 
_not_ a commitment.
