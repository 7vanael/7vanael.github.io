## How should your components relate

The second half of the Package Principles talks mostly about how your 
components should be related to each other. There should be no cycles,
(and if there are, dependency inversion is always available to break it)
everything should depend on something more stable than it is (just good 
building fundamentals really) and your stuff that's the most stable should be 
the most abstract while your most easily changed things can be the most 
concrete. 

**Cheers!**
