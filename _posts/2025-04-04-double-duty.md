## Can you really go twice as fast?

I thought I might be able to be very clever to make two tickets that 
seemed closely related make progress at the same time. It of course 
doesn't really work that way. The tests still have to be written for 
each and the actual separate changes need to be made to make them 
pass. But.. maybe I can think that knowing about the next step 
might have guided my refactor just a little more favorably.
