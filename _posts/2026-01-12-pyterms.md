## More things making me scratch my head in Python

### Ternary operators
```jupyter
def switch_player(self):
    if self.current_player == Board.PLAYER_X:
        self.current_player = Board.PLAYER_O
    else:
        self.current_player = Board.PLAYER_X
```
This seems like a pretty straight forward if-else statement. (In Python, you can also have an unlimited 
number of elif statements after the first if, and the else block is totoally optional).
It has a touch of repetition there, right, but, it is pretty readable since we're familiar with if statements 
generally. But, this is also the kind of argument you could put through a ternary operator
This ternary implementation seems all backwards coming from Clojureland, but here it is: 
```jupyter
def _switch_player(self):
    self.current_player = (
        Board.PLAYER_O
        if self.current_player == Board.PLAYER_X
        else Board.PLAYER_X
    )
```
Ok, so the expression goes inside `( )`, and I think they tried hard to make it 'read' like you might 
say it. 
"The current player is now Player_O if the current_player is Player_X, otherwise it's Player_X". I'm 
not sure this is faster to understand than the traditional if statement from above.
