## The hardest part of my job right now is estimating

The content and learning opportunity and intellectual challenge of my work is all pretty perfect, 
but it seems to be overwhelmed by being run down constantly by deadlines I struggle to meet. Yes, 
I get to set them myself, but at this stage in my journey there's a lot more of "I don't know what I 
don't know" than I seem to be able to reliably account for. My code base has plenty of room for 
improvement (an ongoing process at this time) and the new features frequently push into new directions 
that I haven't traveled in before (by design to be sure). The net result is week after week of long 
work days, worked weekends, sleep interrupted by stress dreams, and still topped with disappointing 
deliveries. 

I have to have some faith that, with enough experience, the pool of things that "I don't know I don't 
know" (the most dangerous kind of challenge to face in estimating) will gradually diminish, first flowing 
into he pool of "Things I know I don't know" and, finally, with even more time and practice, into 
"things I know". But. I don't feel like I have the luxury of time to wait until this knowledge and 
experience pile up enough to one day be able to estimate better. 

So, I've decided to start doing some research. I've invited a couple fellow apprentices to read 
Agile Estimating and Planning by Mike Cohn with me (at least it seems I'm not alone in my struggles). 

Here's to hope!
