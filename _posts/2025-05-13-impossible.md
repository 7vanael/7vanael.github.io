## Isn't the sky the limit?

Maybe, but there may be a mathematical one you reach first. It snuck up on me because 
the step just before it was very challenging, but achievable. Who wouldn't expect the 
next progression to also be very challenging? 

I've been stuck before, on more problems and occasions than I'd prefer to 
detail. And, just about every time, there was just a little more I needed 
to learn or another way I needed to approach to see or grasp the solution. 

The new skill to add to my tool belt is a sense for when circling the problem 
again isn't going to make it possible. That can be made more challenging if the 
grit and determination you've been exercising the development of are getting 
strong! That's one kind of win, but now should also be tempered by some sense. 

I have an inkling that there could come a time when, even if something is possible,
the effort required to do it wouldn't be worth it. I hope that I'm able to see it 
coming before I'm already half-way through.

**Cheers!**
