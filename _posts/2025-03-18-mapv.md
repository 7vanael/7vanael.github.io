## The functions we know may have less than obvious use cases

So mapv, you've probably seen it before. It accepts a function and at least one 
but up to several collections. It will then perform the function on the first 
element of each collection, and continue until any one collection runs out of 
elements.  
````
(mapv f coll)
(mapv f coll1 coll2 ...)
````

You can use this to manipulate one set with another, or perhaps just perform 
the same function on each element of one set. 

The effect that did not immediately jump out to me but that it definitely 
does, is transpose the rows into columns (and vice versa) of a collection of 
collections (with the help of vector)! 

From [the docs](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/mapv) :

````
(apply mapv vector [[:a :b :c]
                    [:d :e :f]
                    [:g :h :i]])
;;=> [[:a :d :g] [:b :e :h] [:c :f :i]]
````

This is especially helpful if you already know how to handle rows but 
also want to evaluate columns - now you can reuse your code, with one 
simple transformation. 

One potential downside to note is that this does not produce a lazy sequence, 
so use with infinites or very large collections with care.
