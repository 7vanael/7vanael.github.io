## Put your namespaces in packages already!

After spending far too long combing through every file in my project directory to 
verify that every reference was updated to almost every single other file in my 
project, I can only strongly recommend that if you foresee needing to bundle 
your project into packages, do so _early._ 

Sure, that ever-growing list is approachable for you right now, but we are also 
building for others. The chaos gives anyone else no clue where to start or what 
they're even looking at. 

Jumping into the maintenance early means it isn't nearly so troublesome when 
you get into it. I wish I had started mine when I had three files to rename and 
re-reference, not 16.

**Cheers!**
