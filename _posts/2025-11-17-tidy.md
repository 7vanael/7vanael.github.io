## Tidy

As our project nears launch, and we are closing the cone of uncertainty, the possibilities we left open on the first 
pass are needing to be made concrete, lest the launch take forever. So, I had a little story to add a section to a page. 
Easy, lovely, done. But just above it, there was a little note my prior self had left suggesting that, once we had a 
target, this button should really point to a particular product, not just scroll to the product carousel. 

Well, I think we're about to a product that I can point to, and this note shouldn't really live here forever (perhaps 
some would say it shouldn't live there at all) so while I'm in this file, I might as well just make it work the way 
we thought it should in the first place! Tidy. 

Sure, I can make my test pass, and that's lovely, but what's very curious is that, when experimenting with the behavior 
I wanted in the browser, I discovered that the permalink for the product isn't what I thought it was. And, it turns out, 
I can't seem to update it in the UX. Sure, I can repl in and manually update the data, but that isn't going to solve 
the problem for next time.

Well, darn. I tried to tackle the lingering to-do's, and ended up with a new bug story. So much for Tidying up!

**Cheers!**
