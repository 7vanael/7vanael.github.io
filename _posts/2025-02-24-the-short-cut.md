## The short-cut may be shorter, but there's a reason it isn't the main path

If it were easy or obvious to most travellers, there wouldn't even be a 
short-cut, it would just be the road. And while there may be a dozen ways up
the mountain, some of them are definitely more direct. 

That directness has some hurdles to it; it requires knowledge, skill, and practice. 
The first trip up a new mountain will almost certainly never be the best. But taking 
a wandering first path, with the sprawling ugly methods, the repeated code 
and nested within nested loops is how you find the opportunities for trimming
in the first place. 

After all, it's easier to assess the path once you've made it to the top.

**Cheers**
