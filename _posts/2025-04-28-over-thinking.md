## Sometimes I'm primed to see what I've already seen

This story started out with a gross under estimation of a task. 
I was primed then to see achievable tasks where I had been successful 
in what at first blush, seemed to be a similar task before. 

Now, I ended the weekend worked up about how I was going to 
get the game to add even more things to the state about the 
board. Was I going to have the game get the available moves? How could 
I keep the board isolated from my gui implementation? It was a very 
stressful problem to solve!

Thank goodness for the craftsman who have patience to remind me that my 
board is one of the abstract cores of my game.. _**of course**_ the 
modules with the details of implementation need to depend on it! 
I'd like to believe that in a slightly more rested state I would have 
come to that realization on my own.

Whew. In a task filled with high mountains to climb, it's best not 
to turn molehills into more!

**Cheers!**
