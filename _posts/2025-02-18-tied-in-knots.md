## Day two is for untangling knots 
As I work through the Clojure Koans, I have flashbacks to the weekend after Thanksgiving and facing the
knotted, tangled and tied cluster of Christmas lights. I'm certain they were put away with a plan, 
that they weren't actually tied into knots to spite our future selves and that they will come apart 
into individual strands if I approach it right, but that doesn't stop the bewildered stare I find 
on my face anyway. 

There's a good bit of tangle between me and being able to intuit anonymous functions called as 
parameters to functions that provide the parameter. But I got the lights untangled last year, and
you'd best believe I'm going to unravel the logic in Clojure before long!

**Cheers!**
