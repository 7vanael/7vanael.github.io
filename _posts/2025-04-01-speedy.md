## Sometimes fast just isn't fast enough!

I've been relentlessly practicing iterations of my kata for this 
week and am just having the darnedest time getting my demonstration 
to be less than the cut-off time. 
My real, test-driven development time is about 28 minutes. But, 
that's too long. No one, especially not me, wants this to last for 
28 minutes. So, after each pairing, trying a different data structure, 
trying a little leap, trying a different order of development, 
the minutes are inching off. 

My current time is 18 minutes. That's a good third off my baseline best, 
but still 3 minutes too long. At this point I'm trying to think of ways 
to minimize, unfortunately the nature of the program often requires 
4 test scenarios for each rule and those are just a little tricky to 
speed through!

I'll have to put on my running shoes in the morning and be aiming for a 
PR!

**Cheers!**
