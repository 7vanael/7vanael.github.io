## Day four is for slowing it down 
I started in on the Euler problems today with the target to be practicing 
test driven development. It takes a strange type of restraint to 
write code that I *know* I'm going to have to fix in a few minutes.

I'm practicing keeping the focus very small, but the urge to look at the bigger picture
is strong. But, the plan remains, trust the process, follow the rules, reshape my way
of thinking and planning. 

**Wish me luck!**
