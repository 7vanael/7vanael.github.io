## Your destination is just around the corner!

And, while I'm sure it's down this path somewhere, it turns 
out, I'll have to round a couple more corners on the way at least!

It's tricky having the exact destination just out of sight because 
of course, you can easily misjudge just how much out of sight it is. 

I nearly thought I had finally pegged an iteration well, my code 
looked the way I expected, my tests were all green. But, I guess the 
gamer in me just had to play the game. And then of course, I couldn't. 

But the code logic was sound! The functionality is there! Unless of 
course, you actually want the experience to be acceptable. 

At least one more corner to see the other side of.

**Cheers!**
