## It's a lot harder to do when there's an intentional audience

I've only ever really *performed* a dance for an audience once
in my life, and even then I practiced for months in advance, and 
it wasn't even the main event. I've danced in public, sure, but mixed 
in the crowd with everyone else doing their own thing and no one 
worried about what ever anyone else was up to. 

Performing for an audience with everyone watching is a rather uncomfortable
experience at best, and certainly not helped by also being a novice and knowing
that constructive feedback from mostly strangers awaits. 

Does it get better in time, or is this experience of discomfort the point?
I guess we'll find out in time.

**Thank goodness for Friday**
