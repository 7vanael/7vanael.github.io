## A brief overview of a handy data structure

Hashmaps are a modifiable Java data structure that can be used to store key value 
pairs. It can be used with most objects (not primitive data types like 
int, but Integer is fine) so long as they implement hashCode() and 
equals() methods. 

They use put instead of add and require some slightly special syntax 
for iterating, but are pretty easy to use: 

````
 HashMap<String, Integer> kitchenInventory = new HashMap<>(16, 0.75f);

        kitchenInventory.put("Coffee", 1486);
        kitchenInventory.put("Almonds", 37);
        kitchenInventory.put("Blueberries" , 42);

        System.out.println("Size: " + kitchenInventory.size());

        kitchenInventory.remove("Almonds");

        for(Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : kitchenInventory.entrySet()){
            System.out.println("Key: " + entry.getKey() + " Value: "  + entry.getValue());
        }
````
Hashmaps are great to use when you need to be able to efficiently search 
or modify a dataset. 
For almost every operation of adding, removing or finding, it has an O(1). 
It does diminish to O(n) if you search by value (but, really, you should 
be searching by key!). 

By comparison, LinkedList has an O(n) for almost every operation with 
the single exception of modifying at the very beginning or end of the 
list where it can get to O(1). 

ArrayList has some better performance than LinkedList, you can add to the 
end and search it by index in O(1) speed, however is otherwise mostly O(n) 
for performance. 

One factor that would certainly be a barrier to using Hashmaps is if the 
order of the elements need to be maintained; It's a map and so doesn't
maintain order. For that, your Lists are a better bet.
