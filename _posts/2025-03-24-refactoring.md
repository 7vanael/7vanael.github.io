## A necessary step, but sometimes feels like going backwards

I've been struggling with refactoring. I think I must be doing something not quite well 
because once my project gets to anything more than a simple set of functions, I feel 
like I'm spending as much or more time on refactoring my tests to make sense again. 

I know that refactoring the source code is necessary; it needs to get broken down and split out and 
then maybe you decide you state needs a new field, and then maybe it turns out it doesn't after 
all, and then... nope, yep, should have left it in!

So many changes seem like I then need to go back and modify how I'm testing and I'm pretty sure 
that isn't how it's supposed to go. 
Maybe I'll figure out how to put the shovel down eventually. 
Here's to hoping!

**Cheers!**
