## When you want to know which of your options is the best option

And you need to be able to specify *how* to measure best. The answer is almost definitely 
which one is the biggest (duh) but, biggest how? The longest string? `(max-key count 
"abc" "abcd" "vwxyz") => 5`

What about for a set, or a map? Sometimes you might need to compare the values to each
other `(apply max-key val {:a 1 :b 3 :c 5}) => 5` or, if you want the key that stores the 
highest value: `(key (apply max-key val {:a 1 :b 3 :c 5})) => :c`

It works on vectors too! 
Let's say I had a data set that looked something like:
[[[2 0] 10]  [[0 1] -9] ...[[x y] score]]

and I wanted to pull out of it just the [x y] that was associated with the best score.

I could use `(apply max-key second [data])` to tell it to look at the second item in 
each pair in the set-- in this case, the score. Apply is necessary here because I want 
it to iterate over each pair in the list and get the second item in each pair. I can 
now just take the first item returned (to get just [x y] instead of the entre 
[[x y] score]) and I'll have the best option of [x y] for the possible available scores!
