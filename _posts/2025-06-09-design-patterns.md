## What's a design pattern and who cares?

Design patterns are a named solution to a problem in a context. 

All parts of that definition matter. 
#### Named
If you don't have a name, how can any one talk about you? When working with 
colleagues, how can you be sure you mean the same structure, or the same object 
if you don't have an agreed upon name? You can't of course, so the name is critical 
to communication. (Names are always important, for patterns, for variables, 
for classes and functions and everything in between!)


#### Solution to a problem

Ok, look, we don't need to go around just slapping names on everything, but 
we do like to talk about solutions! If it didn't solve a problem, you wouldn't 
want to be talking about it anyway. 

#### in a Context

Most precise solutions can't be plugged in just anywhere, they address 
particular needs. 
Creational patterns are used to create instances of objects. 
Structural patterns help set up the communication patterns between separate groups of 
objects. 
Behavioral patterns help you partition the behaviors of your system into discrete 
sets of classes. 

You wouldn't use the Command design pattern to address creational issues, but 
that doesn't mean the command design pattern can't help you in other ways like 
managing the communication between objects. 

I was convinced byUncle Bob that I ought to solidify my foundational knowledge 
of various design patterns by reading the book of the same name by the gang of 4. 

Should be a good read!
