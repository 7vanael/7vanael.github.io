## Day one on a new job, with new skills, new friends and a new way of life just ahead of me. 
The rate of 'new' around me is higher than usual, but it's definitely what keeps the next bite of life more interesting than the last. 
Today is for getting my legs under me, the blog up and running, and to start finding my way through Clojure. 
I've deployed websites before, but I'm very intrigued about how using Jeckyll will be different from Vue and which one I'll end up making my default. 

**Cheers!**
