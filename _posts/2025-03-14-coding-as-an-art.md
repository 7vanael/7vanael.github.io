## Clean Coders postulates that coding is a craft, a creative practice
### To the extent that it is creative, it is art

The trouble, or perhaps the beauty is that as much as code 
is concrete, with a set outcome, frequently mathematical in theme, the 
"goodness" of it can be highly subjective. 

Your tests can tell you if it works as expected, your willingness to make 
changes to it can tell you if it's flexible and your bugs can tell you if 
it's clean. But beyond that, there is a quality that I think draws some 
of us to certain solutions or goals (and pushes us away from others) that 
aren't quite as easy to articulate due to this unusual duality in the nature 
of coding.

Sometimes you see a solution and immediately know "Oh, that's good!" and we 
like that feeling. The problem is, not everyone appreciates the same piece of art 
the same way. Personally, very little of Picasso's art speaks to me, but I 
accept that I must just be missing some perspective because so many others 
widely appreciate his work. I'll take most anything by Van Gogh or Monet any day 
though! 

You can't get too blue for me. And I know the lines aren't clear, and maybe 
it just reminds me of what the world looks like through uncorrected vision, 
and what's even the point in that? I couldn't tell you. And it doesn't matter. 
Because you just know what you like when you see it. And if you study a while 
you may learn the vocabulary to express that monochromatism or impressionist 
takes aren't your cup of tea, but they are no less right than the ultra realism 
of Rembrandt (who, while clearly very talented, is just too often too dark for 
my taste).

All this to say, as an apprentice craftsman, taking time to see and appreciate 
the variety of takes from the skilled craftsmen around me is sure to be filled 
with perspectives that have different priorities, preferences and requirements. 
None of them are wrong, but each have a value that I hope I will one day be able 
to balance and blend into my own craft.
