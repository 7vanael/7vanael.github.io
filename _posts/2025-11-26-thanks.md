## Thanks

It's the time of year to take stock of your progress from the year 
and to appreciate the abundance of your circumstance. 

This has certainly been a challenging year with plenty of obstacles to 
overcome, and plenty of growth through sweat and tears (finally, no blood 
though!) I'm so thrilled that I'm beginning to appreciate the yield though. 
I appreciate the mentors who have helped me along the winding path I've 
taken, often with just-in-time sign posts to get me back the right direction. 
I love that I'm getting to spend my time working with a team where there are 
a variety of backgrounds, knowledge bases and approaches. While there are 
core principles we are all working on top of, there is so much room still for 
style, approach and techniques, and I'm certain I'll become a better coder 
for the breadth that's here. 


And so, for the challenges, the patience, the guidance,

**Thanks!**
