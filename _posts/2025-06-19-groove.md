## When it finally locks in

After ages of struggling, of ironing, of hammering into place, and reworking the 
architecture, and making all the mocks and socks and polk-a-dots just right, I finally 
had a feature that was a dream to implement. 

It still had some funny bits that were a challenge to solve, but I had already done 
enough of a foundation that I had testing tools in place and had practiced with 
them on several prior features, my code had a well-developed pattern for implementing 
new features, and the new knowledge required to do it was achievable and easy to 
visualize, and thus easy to understand. It was perfect. My code was pretty darn neat 
the first time through, and only a little sandboxing was needed to test where the 
new functionality was getting to. 

The best decision I've made all week was probably in deciding to tackle a different 
problem today than the one I've been stuck on. The dopamine hit of success is 
enough to make trying again tomorrow seem worth it again.
