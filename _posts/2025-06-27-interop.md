## Using Java classes and methods in Clojure

Sometimes you might have some perfect solution to your problem, but it's written 
in Java, and you're building in Clojure. Before you give up hope, remember that 
Clojure is a wrapper for Java, so you can translate between them! 

#### A new object
Add a . after the Class.
````
Router router = new Router(server);

(Router. server)
OR
(Router/new server)

````
#### A class method on an object
Keep the .dot notation on the method, but pass the object as the first argument:

````
router.addRoute(arg1, arg2, arg3);

(.addRoute router arg1 arg2 arg3)
````

#### Chained method calls
````
string.trim().toLowerCase().substring(0, 5);

(-> string
  (.trim)
  (.toLowerCase)
  (.substring 0 5))
  
  OR, (for side effects/methods that don't return the object)
  
(doto router
  (.addRoute arg1 arg2 arg3)
  (.addRoute arg1 arg2 arg3))
````

#### Static method calls
````
Math.max(var1, var2)

(Math/max var1 var2)
````

#### Fields within an object
````
Path path = router.path;

(.path router) 
OR
(. router path)
OR
(.-path router)
````


Ok, that's a great start, but, your code does more than methods, it does whole abstract 
architecture plans that include interfaces. What do you do with those?!

#### Interfaces
````
public class ConcreteHandler implements InterfaceHandler {
  public ConcreteHandler(Type name1, Type name2) {
  ```
  }
  @Override
  public Output singleMethodAction(Type input) {
  ```do code stuff here```
  return output;
  }
}


(def concreteHander
  (reify InterfaceHandler
    (singleMethodAction [this input]
      ```do code stuff here```
      output)))
````
Ok, that was a lot. There are some key takeaways; this demonstrates implementing a singe 
method of an interface. You could implement multiple if needed. 
You can't do fancy variable input with this; your method has to take a set number, so if 
you are thinking of a function that takes input of `[& [source]]` maybe think differently. 

#### Type hints
If you have overloaded Java methods, it will not make assumptions about which one you 
are calling so you have to spell out what your object types are. 
````
public Response(String name, int status, String body) {
  ---implementation--
}
public Response(String name, int status, byte[] body) {
  ---implementation--
}


(Response. (str name) (int status) (str body))
````
Now Java will implement the right constructor because you've specified what 
type of data you are providing. 

With all of this, we should be well on our way to making our Java library 
useful in a Clojure environment!
