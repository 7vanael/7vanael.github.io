## When the heady highs of breakthrough rapidly descend into reality

the altitude change can be dizzying! 

After days, and longer days of tinkering, attempting, mushing 
and moulding some parts of my code, I finally, _finally_ got it in the shape I had been trying 
so hard to get it into! It had taken half of forever to get it to a state with a single loop and boy was I 
pleased with it (and, with myself too if I'm honest). 

I'm about to leave town for a regularly planned visit to the wilderness. I'm really a "clean your house 
before you leave town" kind of person. I like to come home to things in order because traveling, even 
if for pleasure, can be a bit discombobulating. (Picking up messy code after you've forgotten where all 
the loose ends are seems like an even worse fate than having to reassemble your closet after the whirlwind 
of packing for a different season!) So, the thrill of breakthrough was only amplified by 
the happy timing that would let me also set it aside in good order without the fear of it haunting me 
through the woods. Talk about a terrifying campfire story! 

The highs of my elation were so swiftly tempered by the realization today that, sadly, my code had 
much further to go than I'd realized and that I now get to choose between being haunted through the 
woods like some black mirror version of blair witch, or some other unsavory combination of lateness and 
sleep loss. 

I'd say to beware of the dizzying heights, but we all know we have to seek them out anyway. Maybe 
just better to beware the downfall of celebrating too early.

**Cheers!**
