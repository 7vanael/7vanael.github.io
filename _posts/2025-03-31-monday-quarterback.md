## It's easy to be critical after the fact, even of yourself


I watched uncle Bob's videos on TDD after doing the lion's share of my 
development work for this iteration. While there's definitely been plenty 
of talk about TDD, getting a more in-depth perspective certainly made 
me almost immediately wish I had the knowledge sooner so that I could 
have used it to do my projects -better-. 

The time is spent already, and while there's always more room for 
improvement, the show sometimes must go on. 

I guess that's just another reinforcement of the idea that, refactoring 
is always best done right now, because when the show moves on, there's 
often no chance to go back later! 

Thankfully, my show is unlikely to be going very far any time soon, 
so there's still hope for me in this case that I can try my hand 
at my new prespective of TDD.


**Cheers!**
