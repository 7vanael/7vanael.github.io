## Track!

In my recent quest to make a component reactive to a specific change, I encountered a new variation of a more familiar 
function in reagent, `track!`
We know `track` can be used to reference a computed value, and are best when given a named function. They will re-calculate 
when their dependencies change (either datomic, or any atom they use) when you have it dereferenced elsewhere. 
If you never have a track dereferenced, it would never need to run! Handy for saving computational power, but not that useful. 

`track!` is a variant which is not 'lazy' like it's counterpart; it will run on initialization, and then again every 
time one of its dependencies changes (again, datomic or any atom used within it). Idiomatically in clojure, a '!' also 
indicates that side effects are created. 

So, if you just have a specific look up that you want (like, the member of a specific project with a connection-id) that 
you'll then dereference and use, a `track` is perfect. 
If, however, you want to create side effects based on particular changes to values, (for instance, changing the 
selected iteration if the current iteration gets signed), but don't really want to de-reference and use a return value, 
then you might be looking for a `track!`
