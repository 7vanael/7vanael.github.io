## In the Weeds

Just when I start to think I know enough to have a plan I've jumped into a new 
project and get to have a new, humbling experience of being bewildered yet again. 

Despite best efforts, there are still todo's strewn about, warnings not to use 
just the function I had been looking for and, wait, what? They do pretty much 
everything through websocket pushes, not just ajax? And the example route 
that ought to do just what I was hoping for is actually just dead and not 
deleted (but of course, the code I wish I could have plugged into _is_ gone)? 
And, why on Earth is the code that's the closest example to what I'm 
trying to implement in the resources folder instead of the cljs file? And, 
excuse me, it didn't test it's websocket call?? How am I supposed to mimic 
or reuse code that isn't there??

Gah, this was not included in my estimate! 

**Cheers!**
