## Ch. 3, An Agile Approach

A good plan now is better than a perfect plan next week. (Don't let perfect be the enemy of good, 
this is all subject to change anyway.)

This chapter focused heavily on team work, and that while there are different roles, and each role 
has importance, it is more important that they work together. He offered some criteria for having 
and agile team: 

* Works as one
* Works in short iterations
* Delivers something each iteration
* Focuses on business priorities
* Inspects and adapts

These are I think largely just as they sound, but I appreciate that he points out that each 
iteration, not only has the project grown by having new features added, but the team has grown 
in knowledge as well. When it comes to iteration planning, the knowledge gained by the team 
should be incorporated to better reflect more accurate plans, for better or worse. 

He later differentiates the _product knowledge_ from the _project knowledge_ where the former is 
about what should be built and the latter is about the team and the tools. Both should be growing 
and being actively incorporated into the next iteration of the plan. 


#### Levels of Planning
There are different scopes to plan to. In my apprenticeship, I can see as far as this iteration and 
my day today. Working on an actual product should have plans for the release (containing a few 
iterations) and the complete Project (likely several releases, if not ongoing maintenance). 

As developers, we aren't typically concerned with the planning that's even farther out, of the 
portfolio or the strategy, but being aware of them might sometimes provide insight. 

#### Conditions of Satisfaction
The conditions of satisfaction should be agreed upon by both the development team and the customer 
when planning releases. This should be a collaborative process and reflect the business priorities but 
also keep the realistic deliverability as a constraint. 

Each iteration should result in feedback about how to shape the release and subsequent iterations. 
It may be that some items were easy to get through or that a new constraint materialized. Or, perhaps 
the early use of the deliverables generated feedback that future features should move in a different 
direction. 

So long as we are working collaboratively toward a solution, change is expected, not the enemy, and it 
means we are building toward an even better product. Because, in the end, who cares if you built the 
project exactly to the initial specs if you didn't end up building a product anyone wants to use?
