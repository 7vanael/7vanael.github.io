## The end of the week is for philosophy, after all, what's in a name anyway?

I've been watching Uncle Bob, and he has a lot to say about names and 
what they have to do with the cleanliness of your code. 

In order to keep functions small and only doing one thing, you're likely to end up with multiple smaller functions. To keep those clear, you're going to need a clear name. 

Name length of variables and functions are inversely proportional: 
    As the scope narrows, variable names should also narrow
    As the scope narrows, function names should probably get longer

This allows for improved readability by saving space when a variable is only going to be used within 4 lines of being initialized, but clarity as you define increasingly niche functions that perform specific actions. 

Well chosen names for functions, variables and classes is a critical pillar in having readable code. 

**Happy Friday!**
