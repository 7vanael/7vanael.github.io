## Targets

It's important to have something to aim for. Moving is great, but without a target, how do you know if you're moving 
in the right direction? 

In developing a product, we like to have a design to emulate, and acceptance criteria to meet. Then we know what 
to work toward, we can write our specs and 'move' the code closer to the target. 

In professional development, you need targets too. Having over arching goals helps you to know if you're working on 
the right things, making the right progress. And, if they're SMART enough goals that they can be timed, you know
if you're on schedule too. 

I find dissatisfaction tends to start creeping in when targets aren't clear. Clients are dissatisfied with work 
when they can't articulate the goal. Developers are dissatisfied with work when they can't tell if they're any closer 
to being done now than they were yesterday. 

I have renewed appreciation today for the Odyssey map. You can see right where you are, you can see just what you 
have to do now, and you have somewhat of a sense of how much there is left ahead of you. 

If we say life's about the journey (and not the destination), then we'd better get to moving on the map!
