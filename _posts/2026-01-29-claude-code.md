I've been playing for the last day or so with claude code. I have to say, it's pretty cool. After having AI not be quite a 'bad' word but certainly not the word that anyone wanted to hear me use, it's been a shocking transition to really jump in and see how much it can do. 

For free form, greenfield projects that aren't important and aren't going to scale, it's wicked fast. Like. So fast. It just whips it up and it works. Sure, a few corrections here and there, but honestly, brilliant. I put up a new AI tab on my website where I can start showing the things I've made with AI. 

Using it on larger projects that already have architecture is still cool, but not nearly as fast. I was paring with a coworker and claude today and my coworker asked if it ws really faster working with Claude than doing it myself. I'm not sure yet, but I think it could be better. I think there's more for me to learn here, especially in setting up the default context to guide more carefully claude's direction. 

I also may have been throttling it myself by only elaborating on bits at a time, because I still expected it to work the way I work. First this piece, then the next. I also wanted to still go through every change, line by line and give feedback and revisions along the way. This could be improved with a context I trusted more. And, perhaps more experience. The trouble is, I'm hesitant to let experience foster trust, because claude could be changed out from under me at any time. So, with people, you develop trust with experience because it's the same person. And so, you can form a relationship and develop trust. This isn't the same though, is it? 
So, a new foundation for trust needs to be found (for me, to move faster any way)
