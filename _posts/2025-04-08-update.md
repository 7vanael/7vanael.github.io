## Sometimes it feels different when used differently

I know I've used update before. It's a certainty. But when I was 
using it before it was on a state, and now it's on a map. What's 
the difference, you may ask, between my state, and a map, for 
isn't a state just a specific map that you've decided to pass 
around a lot? 

I know. It is. But today I re-learned how to use update. Because 
sometimes you aren't just filling in a new answer, sometimes 
you are systematically changing many of the answers! 

Update can be called several different ways, because there might 
be several different use cases. 

````
(update map-name key function)
````
This would be a helpful signature if you had a map and wanted 
to update the value for a particular key given a formula. 

It might look a little like: 
````
(update map pos (fn [score] (+ line-score (or score 0))))
````

And, if you paired it with another method of processing parts of 
a collection in sequence, you could then update a whole series 
of positions with a new score. 

````
(defn update-position-scores [space-score-map board line line-score]
  (reduce (fn [map pos]
            (if (board/available? board pos)
              (update map pos (fn [score] (+ line-score (or score 0))))
              map))
          space-score-map
          line))
````

Anyway, there's still so many ways to surprise me about how 
to process data in a pipeline!
