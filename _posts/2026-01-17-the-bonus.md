| ------------------------------- |----------------------------------------------------|
| `assert_called_once()`          | Called exactly once (args don’t matter)            |
| `assert_called_once_with(a, b)` | Called exactly once with these args                |
| `assert_called_with(a, b)`      | Last call had these args                           |
| `assert_any_call(a, b)`         | One of the calls had these args                    |
