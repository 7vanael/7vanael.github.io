## For if you want to maybe have a variable or maybe not

Sometimes you only sometimes need a variable. 
If something meets a condition, you might want to capture 
and use it, but if nothing does, then don't bother. 

I've been messing around with a refactor of an age-old 
problem of finding if a number is a Fizz or a Buzz (or both?!).
In my pursuit of making each function of my solution only 
responsible for one thing, AND open to additional function, 
I've been trying to get the special rules named a single place 
and then not mentioned again anywhere else. 

Currently, I'm reasonably satisfied with my:
```
(def special-rules 
    {15 "FizzBuzz", 3 "Fizz", 5 "Buzz"}
```

But, then comes the trouble of selecting the key AND using 
the key, but only IF there's one that I need. After all, 
most numbers won't match. 

Here is if-let to the rescue!

````
(if-let [special-number (get-factor n)]
    (get special-rules special-number)
    n)
````
With if-let, (and an extracted function to evaluate if I have
a special case on my hands or not), I can use the special-number 
variable to retrieve the associated value in my special-rules map. 
But, if there is no special number found, I can carry on with n. 

Delightful.
