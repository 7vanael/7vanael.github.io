## Detailed View

I've been going through some content that I went over early in my apprenticeship to review for 
new Odyssey content consideration. We had decided to divide and conquer several videos so we could 
cover ground faster, and when we regrouped to review our findings and our recommendations, we found 
that one video in particular was giving the group some difficulty in figuring out how to deliver the 
meat in the way that made the most sense, so we decided we'd all dive in and give it another pass to see 
what we all came up with. 

In our video assessments, we've been chunking up the videos by chapter so we could decide which chapters 
to include, so our notes are frequently like that as well. Lots of detail, up close and personal 
with all of the grit of each little part of the content. And, honestly.. it was a lot. 
The architecture has tangents about the Model -View- Controller and how it isn't what it used to be, 
what it is now, and how it really _should_ work with your program set up. 
It has details about what's an entity vs. an Interactor (what even is that?) and a Boundary. Those 
just aren't terms we use daily and it's all very academic and feels very crunchy. My notes on each chapter 
are honestly not very great. 

But! Then I remembered, I had been taking notes on these videos all along. I went back and reviewed 
the notes I took on the exact same content 9 months ago, less than one month into my apprenticeship. 
You know what? I think my notes from then are the most concise takeaways that emphasize the points of 
the video without getting caught up in the nitty-gritty details. Sure, I noted the definition of the 
Interactor, but it's just a passing note, not a whole section. Which is what it should be! 

So, sometimes, maybe the detailed view is a little too up close and can have you miss the forest for 
detailing each of the individual trees.
