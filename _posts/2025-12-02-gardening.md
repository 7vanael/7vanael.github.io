## Gardening

There are certain rules for planning and estimating stories for a project. 
Every story has to have value to the customer. If it doesn't get them something, 
why on Earth would they pay for it? 

That means there's never a story for 'refactor the code', right?

Well.. only kind of. Because what it really means, is that in almost every 
story on an established product, you should estimate with the fact in mind 
that you're almost definitely going to have to do some refactoring. Maybe 
nothing major, but definitely something. 

You'll see a gardener in their garden every week at least, perhaps much more often, 
even when it isn't the time to plant or harvest. Why? Because, wild growth is 
_wild_. To get the best yield, you have to do some trimming, some pruning, some 
help along the trellis, and even some weeding throughout the entire process.

So, plan your stories to have time for weeding, for learning how to spot the weeds, 
and how to make room for growth, and estimate accordingly!
