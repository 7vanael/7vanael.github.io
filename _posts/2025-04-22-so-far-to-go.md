## When you realize that, despite how far you've come, there's still so far to go

I'm not sure at what point it became clear that this sprint was going to 
not be completed in time. I had thought that I had done well enough to 
isolate my calls to the console in a single name-space, but hadn't yet implemented 
the defmultis to really segregate them. It was a much longer process to implement 
than I had estimated, but then of course was the entire quil implementation. 
I had a false sense of capability in quil because I had of course used it for 
my Langton's ant project. Really, while the persnickety details of UI are 
a bit of a chore, the core functionality didn't seem that hard. 

Of course, that didn't account for the player configuration, the board selection, 
the rendering different boards AND the clicks to see if something happens? But, 
then, wait, how do I get something to actually happen?

Yikes.

I am in way over my head.

**Cheers!**
