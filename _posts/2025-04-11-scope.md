## It can totally change your view

Some tasks that seem impossible get way more possible if you narrow the 
scope. I struggled -hard- with getting my kata presentation for Langton's 
ant down to the 15-minute time frame. Thankfully, in the review I was advised 
to just take the last step out and have it done elsewhere. It wasn't that 
the last step was such a feat, but it required the building of a data 
structure, and then the expected resulting data structure, that just took so 
much time to write tests for. 

The interesting work was in the little details, the last step was mostly 
repetition of adding them together. But, with the more focused scope, 
the time frame was readily achievable after dozens of failed attempts.
