## Reasons for code to stick together

The package principles are in two parts, the first is about how to decide 
which functions belong together. 
There have to be enough of them to constitute a group that warrants maintenance,
they have to be accountable to the same responsibility, and they have to 
work together. 

These principles have some good translations to groups, or at least working 
groups. It's good to have reasons to stick together.
