## These two weeks are the bootcamp immersion course in defmultis

From having only cursory exposure to defmultis to refactoring most 
of my code to be using defmultis, this has been an intensive period 
of exposure and, largely, delight. 

I have had some challenges seeing the translation from Java to Clojure 
as I've come along, but I think I'm finally starting to not 
see all of my code in Java first. Yes, defmultis can function the 
way an interface does, but it's actually easier for me to see it 
as a dispatcher rather than a point of coupling. Prepare this fruit; but 
if it's an apple, core it, and if it's a banana, peel it. Same objective, 
but different behavior based on the type. 

I'm excited to feel like I'm seeing glimpses of the target land of 
clojure bliss through the trees now. I still have a long way to go, but 
I can tell I'm making progress. 

**Happy Friday!**
